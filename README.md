### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I write software. Sometimes Go, sometimes Rust, rarely anything else these days.

I can be insufferably hawkish about Rust. You know the type.

~~Sometimes (usually a few times a week) I [stream myself coding on twitch](https://twitch.tv/uuayn). Mostly this consists of mumbling profanities under my breath as I blunder my way through a wide variety of code trying to wrap my puny brain around how it all works. I like chatting with viewers, answering questions, and showing off my mediocre code.~~

The thing above was true a few months ago. Lately I haven't felt like streaming much. Maybe in the future.
